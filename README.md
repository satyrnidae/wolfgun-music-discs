# Wolfgun Music Discs

## Building from Source (only method)

1. Get the music files from Wolfgun's Bandcamp:
    - [RUNNING](https://wolfgun.bandcamp.com/album/running)
    - [RUNNING II](https://wolfgun.bandcamp.com/album/running-ii)
    - These are pay-what-you-want. I do recommend paying at least a bit of money to Wolfgun.
    - Download the media files as OGG Vorbis. Place them in common/src/main/resources/assets/wolfgun_music_discs/sounds/records, renaming them in the readme.txt file in that directory.
2. Open build.gradle in your preferred editor and use gradle to build the mod.
